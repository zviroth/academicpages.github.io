Hi! I'm Zvi. I was born in Australia, and grew up in Israel. I now live in Maryland, with my wife and two kids. 

I completed a BSc in Physics and Computer Science, and a PhD in Computational Neuroscience, at the Hebrew University. I'm currently a postdoc at the Lab of Brain and Cognition at the National Intitute of Mental Health. 

I strive to understand how the human brain represents the visual world. My research focuses on how diverse factors, both internal and external, affect neural representations in visual cortex. My goal is to uncover the neural mechanisms that give rise to visual perception and to understand how endogenous brain signals shape these perceptual representations. 

My approach involves linking non-invasive measurements of human brain activity with perception and behavior through computational theory. The models I build are based on canonical mechanisms that are likely to be present in many other neural systems, and therefore the principles I uncover are applicable across the brain.
