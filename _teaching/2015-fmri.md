After teaching for two years at ELSC, I decided to create a new course that focused on my own field of research. 
The course covered the basics of MRI and hemodynamics, different fMRI experimental designs, various methods to analyze fMRI data, the neural basis of BOLD, and the principles of visual cortex that fMRI has been able to reveal. I taught this course for the next 2 years, right until I left for my postdoc. During the course I got to meet students from many other labs at Hebrew University, and some long-lasting relationships were created. 

The course was a success, and continues to take place biennially.
