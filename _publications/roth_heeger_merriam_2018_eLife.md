excerpt: 'To link measurements of neural activity in human subjects with perception we built a computational model of V1. But unlike previous work, we included in the simulation the surrounding grey background, which provided a visual ‘context’ to the stimuli. Our model was not expected to have any orientation selectivity since the orientation channels from individual model neurons cancel out as a result of pooling. But when we included the visual context in the simulation, we found robust, large-scale orientation information in the model’s output. We argued that this orientation selectivity was entirely due to visual context, and we provided a mechanistic explanation for how it might manifest in the brain. This phenomenon, which we termed ‘stimulus vignetting,’ is counter-intuitive because it implies that orientation selectivity reflects not only stimulus orientation, but stimulus contrast and shape as well. We have used the model to predict neural responses to novel stimuli, and we have confirmed these predictions with high-resolution, high-field strength fMRI.'

Abstract: Neural selectivity to orientation is one of the simplest and most thoroughly-studied cortical sensory features. Here, we show that a large body of research that purported to measure orientation tuning may have in fact been inadvertently measuring sensitivity to second-order changes in luminance, a phenomenon we term ‘vignetting'. Using a computational model of neural responses in primary visual cortex (V1), we demonstrate the impact of vignetting on simulated V1 responses. We then used the model to generate a set of predictions, which we confirmed with functional MRI experiments in human observers. Our results demonstrate that stimulus vignetting can wholly determine the orientation selectivity of responses in visual cortex measured at a macroscopic scale, and suggest a reinterpretation of a well-established literature on orientation processing in visual cortex.
